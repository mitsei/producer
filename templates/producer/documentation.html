                    <h1>Introduction to the service, V2</h1>
                    <h2>Changes</h2>
                    <p>
                        Several optimization changes were made to V2 of this API, to speed up
                        delivery of data. As a result, the behavior of some endpoints changed
                        significantly enough that the API has been up-versioned. Changes
                        include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Item files are no longer included in the item JSON for LIST
                                responses (they are included in individual item responses).
                                You can include a `?files` parameter in your LIST GET, and
                                the service will add the file URLs to each item. However, you
                                will take a performance hit...
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The production host has changed to `qbank.mit.edu`.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You can request the <a href="#getStudentResponse">last student response</a>
                                from a taken session.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If an app wants to give the student the option of viewing an answer,
                                it can call the <a href="#questionSurrender">surrender</a> endpoint.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                For files that are stored remotely, in AWS, they are given
                                to you as expiring CloudFront URLs. Alternative file storage systems are
                                also supported for legacy data (base64 encoded local files). This was enabled in
                                V1 of the API, but explicitly called out here.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Instructors can now <a href="#commenting">comment</a> on a student response.
                                Students can also <a href="#getAllComments">view all comments</a> for one of
                                their responses.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Banks now carry a <code>color</code> attribute, to help persist UI designs. More
                                detail can be found in the <a href="#bankColor">bank color</a> section.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Servers</h2>
                    <p>
                        We currently support two servers, a production server and a
                        development server. We encourage you to test your app against
                        the development server before switching to the production service.
                        Note that data on the development server has no permanence or
                        guarantee against changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Development server:
                        <pre>https://assessments-dev.mit.edu/api/v2/assessment/</pre>
                        Production server:
                        <pre>https://qbank.mit.edu/api/v2/assessment/</pre>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Developer Notes</h2>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You must end your URLs in a "/".</li>
                            <li>Depending on how files were uploaded, they may be
                                returned in a base64 encoded format.
                                To use them, just base64 decode them and write them to disk / memory.</li>
                            <li>
                                If files were uploaded to remote storage (i.e. AWS), they will
                                only be returned to you as expiring URLs, for security reasons.
                            </li>
                            <li>Calls should be made with Content-Type "application/json" if no
                            files are involved. Otherwise multipart/form-data is appropriate.</li>
                            <li>You must use one of the authentication methods outlined
                            in this document. There is no guest access.</li>
                            <li>If you need a public / private keypair, contact
                            assessments-admin [at] mit [dot] edu.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h1 id="authentications">Authentication</h1>
                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p class="">
                        RESTful API requires use of signature verfication via public / private key, like Amazon AWS.
                        Currently, we use a library that follows the draft IETF standards for signing HTTP requests:
                        <pre><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-cavage-http-signatures/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-cavage-http-signatures/</a></pre>
                        Apps that will use a signed HTTP request will need to pass in the username of the
                        user they with to authenticate. This should be in an 'X-Api-Proxy' header. The app's
                        public key should go in the 'X-Api-Key' header.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Touchstone Authentication</h2>
                    <p>
                        In a web browser, if you have been granted permission, you may
                        view an interactive version of the API. This can help with debugging
                        and testing, as it lets you POST, PUT, GET, and DELETE objects
                        within each endpoint of the service. To reach this endpoint,
                        add "/touchstone/" to the root URL of any call.
                        <pre>https://assessments-dev.mit.edu/api/v2/assessment/banks/</pre>
                        Becomes:
                        <pre>https://assessments-dev.mit.edu/touchstone/api/v2/assessment/banks/</pre>
                        <img class="doc_image" src="{{ STATIC_URL }}images/service_in_browser.png" alt="Screenshot of the API's UI in a browser."/>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Non-LTI Authentication</h2>
                    <p>
                        When signing an API request, the following headers MUST be included in the signature calculation:
                        <pre>['request-line','accept','date','host','x-api-proxy']</pre>
                        Where request-line include both method and path of the request, and x-api-proxy is the
                        kerberos username of the student / user. They MUST also appear in that
                        order. The HTTP_AUTHORIZATION header should look something like:
                        <pre>'Signature headers="request-line accept date host x-api-proxy",keyId="some-key",algorithm="hmac-sha256",signature="5CUB27wqW+oPx0ZI/xMhCaU3v/3My4JMeeP5PbWO9Xg="'</pre>
                        You can compare your hashing algorithm with the following input / output.
                        <pre>Headers     : {'Date': 'Tue, 17 Jun 2014 19:26:25 GMT', 'Host': 'testserver:80', 'X-Api-Proxy': 'cjshaw@mit.edu', 'X-Api-Key': 'afakepublicKey!23', 'Accept': 'application/json'}
Secret key  : mdnAf0vTHSU/Ap1qbzZDFblHdiepcPZZ7C7B6p98
Method      : 'GET'
Path        : '/api/v2/assessment/banks/'

Output      : 'Signature headers="request-line accept date host x-api-proxy",keyId="afakepublicKey!23",algorithm="hmac-sha256",signature="tbxfhvEDF/XNvcKiGLLklBpj8ewVVoXfTqqYVwwGV9Q="'</pre>
                        Note that the path requested must be un-encoded. Example:
                        <pre>'/api/v2/assessment/banks/assessment.Bank:53a071c7ea061a0abff13681@birdland.mit.edu/'</pre>
                        Instead of:
                        <pre>'/api/v2/assessment/banks/assessment.Bank%3A53a071c7ea061a0abff13681%40birdland.mit.edu/'</pre>
                    </p>
                    <h2>LTI Authentication</h2>
                    <p>
                        If passing in LTI student data, a second set of parameters needs to be used in the
                        signature calculation (in this order):
                        <pre>['request-line','accept','date','host','x-api-proxy','lti-user-id','lti-tool-consumer-instance-guid','lti-user-role','lti-bank']</pre>
                        Note that this is NOT needed for instructor actions -- do those with non-LTI
                        headers (as above), and make sure that the X-Api-Proxy user is a staff / instructor
                        in the Assessment Service.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Example Workflows</h3>
                    <p>
                        <p>You can see an example workflow from an LTI provider for an instructor

                    </p>
                    <h1>Assessment Banks</h1>
                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Everything in the service is relative to an Assessment Bank.
                        Items live inside of banks, assessments live inside of banks,
                        and assessments taken live inside of banks. Banks symbolize
                        a collection of assessments and a record of when they are
                        presented to students.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In an educational context, one could organize banks by class
                        (i.e. Calc I has its own assessment bank), or by instructor
                        (i.e. Professor X has her own assessment bank). Any
                        collection of questions can be organized here.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Authorizations</h2>
                    <p>
                        Authorizations are managed at the bank level.
                        A person can be given authorizations to specific actions
                        inside of a bank, such as looking up assessments, or
                        creating items. Typically, a faculty member would be given
                        all permissions, while a learner requires (at a minimum)
                        these three:
                        <ul>
                            <li>assessment.Bank%3Alookup%40birdland.mit.edu</li>
                            <li>assessment.AssessmentTaken%3Acreate%40birdland.mit.edu</li>
                            <li>assessment.AssessmentTaken%3Alookup%40birdland.mit.edu</li>
                        </ul>
                        These need to be built into a DL Kit extension and placed on
                        the server-side code. Examples are available upon request.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Data Pagination</h2>
                    <p>
                        Note that all "LIST" type endpoints (banks, items, assessments,
                        etc.) will return
                        a list in the "data['results']" attribute, as well as a paginated
                        set of data. "next" and "previous" links are included for your
                        convenience. To get all data in a single page, you would append
                        <code>?page=all</code> to your request URL. To get a specific page,
                        you can include <code>?page=1</code>, substituting the desired
                        page number. Examples are below, in each section. Note that by
                        default, lists are returned in descending chronological order
                        (newest record first).
                    </p>
                        For "LIST" endpoints, by default V2 of the QBank service does not
                        include file URLs for item files. This is to optimize performance,
                        because the file-signing process for AWS can take quite long for
                        a large list of items. If you, as a developer, decide to get all the
                        files up front with the list, you can include a <code>?files</code>
                        parameter in your request.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any "DETAILS" type endpoints
                        will return the attributes directly in the object. For example,
                        the assessment banks list below shows two banks in the
                        "data" attribute. Below, we will see that individual bank
                        details are embedded directly in a return object.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="assessmentBanksList">Listing all banks</h2>
                    <p>
                        <pre>GET /api/v2/assessment/banks/</pre>
                        A list of all assessment banks on the server is returned.
                        Where possible, the service will always return a "_links" attribute
                        to indicate what other information is available.
                        <pre>{

                    <h1>Items</h1>
                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p class="">
                        Items are commonly referred to as questions. They are composed of
                        a question (Why is the sky blue?), an answer, and possibly
                        hints or solutions (explanations to be shown after a student
                        has responded). Each question should be standalone and include
                        its own introductory text.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Common item formats include multiple-choice, string response,
                        and numerical response. Currently, this service supports
                        the following item types:
                        <ul id="supportedTypes">
                            {% for supported_type in types %}
                                <li>
                                    {{ supported_type.displayName.text }} - {{ supported_type.id }}
                                </li>
                            {% endfor %}
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Items must belong in banks, and this is reflected in their
                        URL endpoints.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="itemsList">Listing all items in a bank</h2>
                    <p>
                        Because items must belong to a bank, it is assumed that
                        your app will know the <code>bank_id</code> of interest.
                        <pre>GET /api/v2/assessment/banks/&lt;bank_id&gt;/items/</pre>
                        Since this is a LIST type call, items are returned in the
                        "data" attribute.

                    <h3>Querying</h3>
                    <p>
                        Once you have an assessment bank, you can query the items in that bank.
                        <pre>GET /api/v2/assessment/banks/&lt;bank_id&gt;/items/query/?&lt;query parameters&gt;</pre>
                        Currently we support querying on four parameters, which you can stack together as AND:
                        <ul>
                            <li>IRT difficulty ==> <code>max_difficulty</code> and <code>min_difficulty</code></li>
                            <li>IRT discrimination ==> <code>max_discrimination</code> and <code>min_discrimination</code></li>
                            <li>Problem name ==> <code>display_name</code></li>
                            <li>Learning objective ID ==> <code>learning_objective</code></li>
                        </ul>
                        An example query URL to get the problems with difficulty between 0 and 1would be:
                        <pre>GET /api/v2/assessment/banks/&lt;bank_id&gt;/items/query/?min_difficulty=0&max_difficulty=1</pre>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Error Codes</h3>
                    <p>
                        <pre>403: {"details": "Permission denied. You do not have rights to view items in this bank."}</pre>
                        You have authenticated to the server, but your username is not configured
                        to view items in this bank. Please contact an administrator.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <pre>404: {"details": "Not found"}</pre>
                        This usually indicates a problem with the server-side view.
                        Contact an administrator.

                    <p>
                        Many of the examples in this doc follow the format for
                        the label ortho faces type. Questions require:
                        <pre>{

    "type"          : "question-record-type%3Alabel-ortho-faces%40ODL.MIT.EDU"

    "side"  : == *.jpg optional, but required if front present ==,
    "top"   : == *.jpg optional, but required if other jpgs present ==
}</pre>
                        While answers require:

        }
    }]
}</pre>
                        Student responses should be in similar format to answers:

                        With files, at least 2 choices are required. Additional choices
                        need to follow the same naming format:

    }]
}</pre>
                        Student responses should be in similar format to answers. However,
                        since any consuming app should have the actual choice IDs at this
                        point, those IDs need to be passed in as the student choices.
                        Also note the use of "choiceIds" plural, even if only one
                        answer is given:

                        You can also add files to edX questions, if they need to be part
                        of the markup. For example, you might include image files or
                        JavaScript libraries. To do this, you use a <code>multipart/form-data</code>
                        POST and include the files. To ensure that files can be placed in the
                        appropriate spot in the question text, client applications should
                        match any src= tag filenames (or equivalent) with the input name in the
                        POST data. For example, if the markup includes an image:
                        <pre>Consider a conical pendulum below:
<img src="/static/pendulum.png"/>
</pre>
                        You should replace this in the markup as: <pre>Consider a conical pendulum below:
<img src="pendulum.png"/>
</pre>
                        Your POST data would then include an input with name <code>pendulum.png</code>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A completed edX input object might look like the following:
                        <pre>{
    "name"          : "a really complicated item",
    "description"   : "meant to differentiate students",
    "question"      : {
        "type"           : "question-record-type%3Amulti-choice-edx%40ODL.MIT.EDU",
        "questionString" : "Jack and Jill sit on a hill. Jack rolls off. Does Jill fall?",
        "choices"        : [
            {"text" :"Yes, she does",

                    <h4>Optional edX parameters</h4>
                    <p>
                        When creating edX problem types, you can include some of the optional
                        edX parameters, like the maximum number of attempts allowed. The
                        supported parameters are below -- include them in your POST data
                        as part of the item's attributes:
                        <ul>
                            <li>edX max_attempts ==> <code>attempts</code></li>
                            <li>edX markdown ==> <code>markdown</code></li>
                            <li>edX rerandomize ==> <code>rerandomize</code></li>
                            <li>edX showanswer ==> <code>showanswer</code></li>
                            <li>edX weight ==> <code>weight</code></li>
                            <li>IRT difficulty ==> <code>difficulty</code></li>
                            <li>IRT discrimination ==> <code>discrimination</code></li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>
                        <pre>POST /api/v2/assessment/banks/&lt;bank_id&gt;/items/</pre>
                        To create a new item, you need to know what item types are
                        supported on the server. An endpoint is provided for this,
                        although currently only <a href="#supportedTypes">a subset of the
                        items in the list are fully implemented</a>.
                        <pre>GET /api/v2/assessment/types/items/</pre>
                        Once the type is known, you can create an item with the appropriate
                        attributes. Note that for Ortho-3D items, a <code>multipart/form-data</code>
                        POST is acceptable, because of the files that need to be included.

                    <p>
                        Items can have "right" answers and "wrong" answers, as well as student feedback
                        for the wrong answers. By default, any answers provided are classified as "right"
                        answers, unless specifically labelled as "wrong". To explicitly define an answer
                        as correct, you can include a <code>genus</code> in the data payload when
                        creating or editing the item answer. It might look like this: <pre>{
    "answers": [{
        "genus": "answer-type%3Aright-answer%40ODL.MIT.EDU",
        "type": "answer-record-type%3Amulti-choice-edx%40ODL.MIT.EDU",
    }]
}</pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wrong answers can include an optional <code>feedback</code> value,
                        which is a string that will be returned whenever a student responses with
                        that incorrect answer. The create payload would look like: <pre>{
    "answers": [{
        "genus": "answer-type%3Awrong-answer%40ODL.MIT.EDU",
        "feedback": "You forgot to divide your answer by the total number of people.",
        "type": "answer-record-type%3Amulti-choice-edx%40ODL.MIT.EDU",
    }]

                    <h3>Error Codes</h3>

                        <pre>403: {"details": "Permission denied. You do not have rights to create items in this bank."}</pre>
                        You have authenticated to the server, but your username is not configured
                        to create items in this bank. Please contact an administrator.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <pre>404: {"details": "Not found"}</pre>
                        This usually indicates a problem with the server-side view.
                        Contact an administrator.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <pre>500: {"details": "Unsupported question or answer type."}</pre>
                        You specified an item type that we do not currently support.
                        Please check the <a href="supportedTypes">list of supported types</a>.

                        Your input data is not in the expected format. Most likely
                        it is not proper JSON. You should check the required
                        attributes for your specific question type. For example,
                        the Ortho-3D label faces type uses <code>integerValues</code> in its
                        answer object, instead of <code>text</code> (for a string response).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <pre>500: {"details": "\\"<key>\\" required in input parameters but not provided."}</pre>
                        You need to supply the missing <code><key></code> parameter in your
                        input parameters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <pre>500: {"details": "\\"<key>\\" is shorter than <some #>."}</pre>
                        The <code><key></code> list provided in your input data must be at least # elements long.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <pre>500: {"details": "X attribute(s) required for Ortho-3D items."}</pre>
                        Your input data is missing some information. For example, X could be
                        <code>manip</code>, which means that a manipulatable Unity asset bundle
                        is required for this type of question.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We offer convenience methods to output individual items in different formats. Currently,
                        we only support edXml (OLX -- Open Learning XML).
                        <pre>GET /api/v2/assessment/banks/&lt;bank_id&gt;/items/&lt;item_id&gt;/edxml/</pre>
                        This should return a structure like the following:

                        After items are created, they can be linked to an

                    <p>
                        Assessments are collections of items. They are offered to students
                        at specific times during a course, and usually include a feedback
                        mechanism (right / wrong).

                        This set of endpoints lets you manage the canonical assessments. They
                        are, by themselves, devoid of any time knowledge (due date, start date),
                        and devoid of student responses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once an instructor uses an assessment in a class, and assigns a
                        start date, due date, duration, etc., that becomes a "clone" of
                        this assessment, or an <a href="#assessmentOffered">Assessment Offered</a>.
                        Once a student attempts to answer the assessment offered,
                        an <a href="#assessmentTaken">Assessment Taken</a> is created and
                        associated with their response.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="assessmentsList">Listing all assessments in a bank</h2>
                    <p>
                        Like items, assessments are always associated with a bank. So
                        it is assumed that you know the <code>bank_id</code> of interest.
                        <pre>GET /api/v2/assessment/banks/&lt;bank_id&gt;/assessments/</pre>
                        Since this is a "LIST" type call, assessments are returned
                        in the "data" attribute.

                    <p>
                        An Assessment Offered is a single instance of an Assessment,
                        typically associated with a start time and duration. Think of
                        it as "this semester's copy" of an assessment.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="assessmentsOfferedList">Listing all assessments offered</h2>

                        Because assessments offered must be associated with a bank and
                        a specific assessment, it is assumed that you know both the
                        <code>bank_id</code> and the <code>assessment_id</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This LIST type call returns the assessments offered in the "data"
                        attribute. Note that "time" related attributes like
                        <code>startTime</code> and <code>duration</code>
                        are structured as dictionary objects.

                        A JSON data package sent to this endpoint should be an object, even if it is blank.
                        If you do not want to include a startTime or duration, then you should pass an empty

                        object.

                        Note that you can either pass a single object, or also concurrently create
                        multiple Assessments Offered in a LIST format.

                        This returns the objects created. If a single object is passed in,
                        a single, created object will be returned. If a list of objects is
                        passed in, a list of created objects will be returned.

                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Assessments taken are a record for each individual student's
                        history of interacting with the assessment. It tracks
                        their response and the time they responded. It is possible
                        for a service consumer to create multiple assessments taken
                        for a single student, but the service will only create a new
                        taken when the previous taken has been responded to / completed.
                        However, this is hidden from RESTful consumers -- which only
                        need to <a href="#assessmentTakenCreate">request a new taken</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="assessmentsTakenList">Listing all assessments taken</h2>
                    <p>
                        Because assessments taken are associated with a specific offering, it
                        is assumed that the consumer knows the <code>bank_id</code> and
                        an <code>assessment_offered_id</code>.
                        <pre>GET /api/v2/assessment/banks/&lt;bank_id&gt;/assessmentsoffered/&lt;assessment_offered_id&gt;/assessmentstaken/</pre>

                    <p>
                        The <code>reviewWhetherCorrect</code> flag in each assessment
                        taken indicates to consuming apps if they should show students
                        the correctness of each response, or under what conditions
                        the assessment author wanted students to view correctness. It
                        is up to consuming apps to honor this flag or not. For high-stakes
                        assessments, most authors do not want students sharing answers,
                        and this flag will be <code>False</code> until after some
                        deadline.

                        This endpoint lists all of the questions for a single assessment.
                        This should be used for a consuming app to display the questions to
                        students. The consuming app should determine the exact UI / UX,
                        i.e. show all questions at once, show one at a time, etc. Some
                        assessments may have flags that indicate how they should be
                        displayed -- for those that do not, consuming apps should use
                        their best judgment.

                        This should be a JSON package that matches the specific assessment type...
                        for example, a string response may expect a different object

                    <p>
                        For example, an Ortho-3D label faces student response might look like
                        the following.
                        <pre>{
    "integerValues":{

                    <p>
                        The service will respond with a simple object declaring if the
                        student response is correct or not. When available, it will also provide
                        feedback in the form of a solution explanation or wrong-answer
                        explanation. For example:
                        <pre>{
    "correct": true,
    "feedback": "Yes, the blue bucket has a higher probability of existing."
}</pre>
                        Or:

                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Once banks have been created, they can be organized into hierarchies.
                        These start out with "root" banks, and then have children attached.
                        Currently only two levels of hierarchy are supported in this service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In an educational context (and when more levels are supported),
                        one can imagine this used to organize
                        data for a university -> department -> degree program -> class.

                        itself still exists, with its items and assessments.

                    <h2>Removing a Child Bank</h2>
                    <p>
                        <pre>DELETE /api/v2/assessment/hierarchies/&lt;root_id&gt;/children/&lt;child_id&gt;/</pre>
                        You can also remove a child bank from its position in the hierarchy.
                        NOTE: this only removes the bank from the hierarchy. The bank
                        itself still exists, with its items and assessments.
                    </p>
