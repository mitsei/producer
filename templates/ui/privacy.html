<h2>
    Personalization and Pedagogical Improvements
</h2>
<p>
    Our goal is to provide current and future visitors with the best possible educational experience. To further this goal, we sometimes present different users with different versions of course materials and software. We do this to personalize the experience to the individual learner (assess the learner's level of ability and learning style, and present materials best suited to the learner), to evaluate the effectiveness of our  materials, to improve our understanding of the learning process, and to otherwise improve the effectiveness of our offerings. We may publish or otherwise publicize results from this process, but only as non-personally-identifiable data.
</p>
<h2>

By continuing to access the Site after such changes have been posted, you signify your agreement to be bound by them. Be sure to return to this page periodically to ensure familiarity with the most current version of this Privacy Policy.
